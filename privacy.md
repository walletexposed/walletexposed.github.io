# **Wallet.Exposed Privacy Policy**
This Privacy Policy is effective as of its first public distribution on **February 17, 2021**.<br />
It was last updated on **February 18, 2021**.<br /><br />


### **Introduction**
The Wallet.Exposed Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains the personal information (“data) that Wallet.Exposed (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects and how it is used, as well as the rights you have for viewing, correcting, and deleting any such personal information.<br /><br />

### **Opting Out**
You have the right to opt out of data collection at any time.<br />
You may also request a copy of your own user data at any time.<br />
To submit either of these requests, please see the “Privacy Requests” section at the end of this Policy document.<br /><br />

### **Mission Statement**
While it is our goal to expose scams in the cryptocurrency world, we have no desire to expose any of your personal information.<br />
We strive to keep your information completely private. We will not sell or rent your personal information to anyone. We will not disclose your personal information except as necessary to provide our services or as otherwise described in this policy. If disclosure of your information is ever required, you will first be provided with notice and the opportunity to consent. <br /><br />

### **Submission Policy**
Wallet.Exposed wants to increase awareness surrounding cryptocurrency scams, but we have no desire to expose private information surrounding the identities of any individuals, even scammers themselves.<br />
When using our [**Submit a Tip**]({{- site.permalink_form_tip -}}) feature, please do not submit private or otherwise personally identifiable information about any person other than yourself. If you fail to comply with this policy, you may be blocked or otherwise prohibited from submitting information to the Wallet.Exposed team.<br />
All user submissions are screened multiple times before publication in order to avoid the release of any private or otherwise personally identifiable information.<br /><br />

### **When We Collect Data**
User data collection occurs during the following situations:
* **Using our website:** We make use of several third-party services that collect data as soon as you visit our website. This can include, but is not necessarily limited to, your general location as identified by your IP Address. This data is anonymized wherever possible, and is not necessarily tied to any personal information. The relevant third parties are GitHub, Cloudflare, Google Analytics, and reCAPTCHA. For example, Cloudflare’s DoS (Denial of Service) Protection may collect your IP address before your computer has finished loading the Wallet.Exposed website. For more information, please see the “Third Parties” section below.
* **Submitting a form:** When you submit a webform on Wallet.Exposed, the form data (which may include your full name and email address, if provided) is processed through Formspree and ProtonMail. If you do not want your data to be processed by Formspree, you may send us an email directly at wallet.exposed@protonmail.com instead of using any webforms on the Wallet.Exposed website.
* **Solving a CAPTCHA:** At certain times during usage of the Wallet.Exposed website, you may be asked to solve a CAPTCHA puzzle in order to prove that you are a human. Information about your session (including but not limited to your IP Address) may be collected by reCAPTCHA, the provider of this service.
* **Communicating with Wallet.Exposed through Other Platforms:** Wallet.Exposed also has a presence on several other social media platforms. These include GitHub (@WalletExposed and @WalletExposedOrg), Reddit (/u/WalletExposed), Twitter (@walletExposed), Facebook (@walletXposed), and Instagram (@walletXposed). If you communicate with us on any of these services, any data contained within the message may be stored on that platform. The third parties who run these platforms may gain access to the same data. We have no control over these third parties and are not responsible for their actions with regard to your data.

<br />

### **What Data We Collect**
By default, when you visit this website, certain information is automatically communicated by your computer and collected by us. This includes, but is not necessarily limited to:
* **Information about your device:** The resolution of your screen, the size of the browser window, the name of your web browser, and information about additional software like Java and Flash which may be present in your browser.
* **Information about your usage of Wallet.Exposed:** The URL of the page you are viewing, as well as the title of the page you are viewing
* **Information about you:** Although we do not collect your IP address, we do collect broad location information which is derived from the IP address. We also collect information about the language settings of each user’s browser. As is explained in the “Google Analytics” subsection of the “Third Parties” section below, your IP address and other PII (Personally Identifiable Information) are considered confidential and will never be made available to the Wallet.Exposed team or distributed to other parties.
* **Information you submit:** When you communicate with Wallet.Exposed, the data which you enter is processed through any of several third party services and stored in one of our “inboxes” on the relevant service. For example, if you use a webform on the Wallet.Exposed website, it will be processed through Formspree and it will end up in our ProtonMail inbox. If you send us a message on Facebook, it will be processed by Facebook and it will end up in our Facebook Messenger inbox. You can request a copy of any personal data, as well as the deletion of your personal data, at any time using the methods described in the “Privacy Requests” section at the end of this document.

<br />

### **How We Use the Data We Collect**
Wallet.Exposed only processes personal information in a way that is aligned with the purpose for which its collection was authorized, and in a matter which is compliant with all privacy regulations (including the General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR). In general, for all categories of data described in the “What Data We Collect” section above, we may use the information to:
* Provide, operate, maintain, improve, and promote the Wallet.Exposed website and services for all users of the Wallet.Exposed website and services.
* Enable you to access and use the Wallet.Exposed website and services.
* Send you communications related to your use of the Wallet.Exposed website and services, including but not limited to our responses to any webform submissions.
* Process and deliver contest entries and rewards, including but not limited to “bounty” programs for the identification and reporting of scams.
* Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities on and in connection with the Wallet.Exposed website and services, including but not limited to the purposes of advertising or marketing.
* Comply with legal obligations, including but not limited to investigation and prevention of any unauthorized, fraudulent, or otherwise illegal activities.
* Personalize the Wallet.Exposed website and services, by researching user preferences and providing content that matches user interests.
* Carry out any other process for which we obtain your consent.

We may combine information we collect, as described in the “What Data We Collect” section above, with other data obtained through third parties described in the “Third Parties” section below. For example, we may combine information entered on a Wallet.Exposed webform with information we receive through an email, in order to enhance our ability to deliver relevant content to users of the Wallet.Exposed website and services.<br /><br />

### **Third Parties**
Wallet.Exposed makes use of multiple third party services. Depending on your specific usage of Wallet.Exposed, the third parties listed below may come into possession of your personal information. We have no control over these third parties and are not responsible for their actions with regard to your data. Each party has its own privacy document, all of which are linked below.<br /><br />

#### **GitHub**
Wallet.Exposed uses **GitHub Pages ([pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/))** as a web host. The content which generates the Wallet.Exposed website is also stored within GitHub repositories. When you visit the Wallet.Exposed website, your computer communicates with GitHub. This communicated information may include, but is not limited to, your general location as identified by your IP address.<br />
We use GitHub and GitHub Pages in order to deliver a consistent web presence to our users in a manner that is also transparent and open-source. By using GitHub’s services, we gain the ability to host our website so that it can be displayed to you.<br />
The **GitHub Privacy Statement** can be found [**here**](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement).<br /><br />

#### **Cloudflare**
Wallet.Exposed uses **Cloudflare ([cloudflare.com](https://www.cloudflare.com/))** for managing some aspects of content delivery such as DNS (Domain Name System) records. When you visit the Wallet.Exposed website, your computer communicates with Cloudflare. This communicated information may include, but is not limited to, your general location as identified by your IP address.<br />
We use Cloudflare to stay protected from things like DoS (Denial of Service) Attacks. Given the role of our website, we are a likely target for such attacks by scammers who may attempt to take down our website. By using Cloudflare for DNS and Content Delivery settings, we ensure a consistent web presence for our users and avoid downtime.<br />
The **Cloudflare Privacy Policy** can be found [**here**](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/).<br /><br />

#### **Formspree**
Wallet.Exposed uses **Formspree ([formspree.io](https://formspree.io))** to process webform submissions. When you submit a form on Wallet.Exposed, a copy of the associated data will be stored on Formspree’s platform for 30 days. A second copy of the data will be sent to the **walletexposed@protonmail</span>.com** email address, and this copy may be retained in the inbox for longer than 30 days.<br />
We use Formspree to enable the submission of webforms within the Wallet.Exposed website. The service is important to us as it enables us to receive form submissions from website users. We rely on user contributions in order to remain aware of activity within the constantly-changing landscape of cryptocurrency. As is true with all data we collect, any personal information submitted through webforms will be treated as confidential unless you explicitly revoke your anonymity.<br />
The **Formspree Privacy Policy** can be found [**here**](https://formspree.io/legal/privacy-policy).<br /><br />

#### **ProtonMail**
Wallet.Exposed uses **Protonmail ([protonmail.com](https://protonmail.com))** in order to receive webform submissions. These submissions are processed by Formspree, as mentioned above, before being sent to our private ProtonMail email address. This data is private, but ProtonMail may use automated systems to scan the contents of these incoming messages for spam prevention. When you submit a form on Wallet.Exposed, a copy of the associated data will be sent to the **walletexposed@protonmail</span>.com** email address, and this copy may be retained in the inbox for longer than 30 days. A second copy of the data will be stored on Formspree’s platform for 30 days, as explained in the “Formspree” section above.<br />
As in the case of Formspree, ProtonMail is crucial for the operation of the Wallet.Exposed website because it enables us to receive form submissions from website users. We rely on user contributions in order to remain aware of activity within the constantly-changing landscape of cryptocurrency. As is true with all data we collect, any personal information submitted through webforms will be treated as confidential unless you explicitly revoke your anonymity.<br />
The **ProtonMail Privacy Policy** is available [**here**]( https://protonmail.com/privacy-policy).<br /><br />

#### **Google Analytics**
Wallet.Exposed uses **Google Analytics ([analytics.google.com](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/))** for aggregated website traffic analysis. This is done in an anonymous fashion in order to ensure user privacy. In order to track your session usage, Google sends your browser a “_ga” cookie with a randomly-generated “ClientID”. This ID is anonymized, and is free of any personal information like your name or email. Google Analytics will also have access to your IP address. Please note that your IP address will not be viewable to anyone, even the Wallet.Exposed team, as it is considered PII (Personally Identifiable Information) which would violate the terms of Google Analytics.<br />
We use Google Analytics to track aggregated website behavior. This includes, but is not limited to, which pages are being viewed by each user and for how long. This information is important to us because it allows us to determine the effectiveness of our website and to make improvements to the services we provide.<br />
Google also releases a **[Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-On](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)** which will automatically prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics. If you would like to request a copy of, or the deletion of, any of your personal information that we possess through Google Analytics, please view the “Privacy Requests” section at the end of this Policy and submit the relevant webform.<br />
The **Google Privacy Policy** is available [**here**](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en).<br /><br />

#### **reCAPTCHA**
Wallet.Exposed uses **reCAPTCHA ([google.com/recaptcha](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/))** in order to prevent bot activity on our website. In some situations, for example when submitting a webform, you may be asked to solve a CAPTCHA test. Google is the provider of the reCAPTCHA service. When you solve a reCAPTCHA on our website, your computer communicates information, including but not limited to your general location as identified by your IP address, to Google. 
The reCAPTCHA integration is crucial for our site’s operation, as it allows us to protect the website and prevent spam submissions by ensuring that active users are human.<br />
The **Google Privacy Policy** is available [**here**](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en).<br /><br />

### **Information Sharing**
Wallet.Exposed reserves the right to work with other third parties (“Service Providers”) who help us run our website and services. Wallet.Exposed does not currently have any such relationship, for business purposes or otherwise, and thus does not currently share any user data. This section exists to explain the possibility of any such relationships in the future, as well as to clarify that confidential user information and other PII (Personally Identifiable Information) will never be sold or used for marketing purposes even in the future.
Specifically, Wallet.Exposed does not and will not permit any Service Providers to sell any personal information they obtain through Wallet.Exposed, or to use any such personal information for their own marketing purposes. Wallet.Exposed will never permit the use of any shared user data for any purpose other than directly in connection with services carried out by Service Providers for Wallet.Exposed.
In addition to the sharing with Service Providers, we also reserve the right to share your information with others in the following circumstances:
* Between employees and team members of Wallet.Exposed, if authorized for specific purposes related to operation of the Wallet.Exposed website and services
* With any potential business partners who may help us distribute the Wallet.Exposed website and services to users
* In the event of a merger, sale, change in control, or reorganization of all or part of Wallet.Exposed
* When required to disclose personal information in response to a subpoena, court order, or other legal process, or in order to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims
* When we have a good-faith belief that sharing is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or otherwise take action against illegal activities, suspected fraud, other violations of our Terms of Use, or as otherwise required to comply with our own legal obligations
* In any other situation not specified above, but only after obtaining your consent
